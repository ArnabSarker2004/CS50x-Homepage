                        Hey, my name is Arnab Sarker. I am a 17 years-old, 11th-grade high school student currently attending a secondary school within Toronto, Canada called R.H. King Academy. I would adore studying in the field of software engineering field in the future at the University of Waterloo. I believe that this is a fantastic way to add to my programming and coding experiences. Moreover, I want to help out the future generations of programmers around my community who want to have an engaging, enhanced foundation for programming and coding to start an amazing journey.
