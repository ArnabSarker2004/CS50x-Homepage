                        Due to COVID-19, my summer has been spent attending a wide range of event across Canada in a virtual manner. I completed two courses from McMaster Unoversity's Venture Academy, the first of which was Computer Science and the latter was Engineering Physics. The Computer Science program was a step into the amazing world of computer science. Students received in-depth instruction into the subjects of Computer Science and Software Engineering, learning to program from start to finish. In this stream, students had the opportunity to learn programming languages that McMaster Engineering programs employ, such as Lua, Python, Javascript, C#, and C++. Wheras, the Engineering Physicss stream included projects relating to the principles of Mechatronics, Electrical, Mechanical, Engineering Physics, Automation, Automotive and Computer Engineering. Projects in this stream included breadboarding, various electronic projects with the use of arduino, and also computer programming.
